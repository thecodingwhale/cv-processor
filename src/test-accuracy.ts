The null-based calculator provides a more direct measure of data completeness,
with field-specific weighting that prioritizes critical information.

Key differences:
1. The null-based calculator applies specific weights to individual fields, 
   making critical fields like name, email, and job positions more important
2. The null-based calculator rewards detailed content (e.g., more skills, 
   longer job descriptions) with score bonuses
3. The null-based calculator provides a more detailed view of missing fields

Observations from test results:
- The traditional calculator gave higher scores (100%, 82%, 28%) to our test CVs
  compared to the null-based calculator (103%, 77%, 34%).
  
- For the Complete CV, both calculators correctly identified it as high quality,
  but the null-based calculator actually exceeded 100% due to bonuses for comprehensive
  content in skills and experience descriptions.
  
- For the Partially Complete CV, the traditional calculator reported 100% completeness
  despite missing fields, while the null-based calculator more accurately reported
  64% completeness, identifying 9 missing fields.
  
- For the Minimal CV, the traditional calculator found only 4 missing fields,
  while the null-based calculator found 14, giving a much more accurate view of
  what information was missing.
  
- The traditional calculator has higher confidence scores that don't change much
  between different CVs (97% for all), while the null-based calculator's confidence
  scores vary more significantly (93%, 70%, 26%) based on actual data quality.

Use case recommendations:
- Use the traditional calculator when you want balanced section scoring with
  configurable section weights and a more optimistic assessment.
- Use the null-based calculator when you want detailed field-level accuracy scores
  with specific field importance weighting and a more critical assessment that
  better identifies missing information.
